# Custard Pudding

**Serving Portions**: Approximately 1 Pound Cake Container

### Ingredients
* Caramel:
	* Granulated Sugar: 60g
	* Water: 25 cc
* Pudding Liquid:
	* Milk: 750 cc
	* Vanilla Essence: 1 tsp
	* Eggs: 5
	* Egg Yolk: 5
	* Granulated Sugar: 110 g

### Preliminary Actions
* Place bowl in cold ice water (while mixing).
* Preheat oven to 160 C (320-325 F).

### Preperation Instructions
1. In a pot, heat the granulated sugar and water to make the caramel. Let it boil and stir it until the liquid turns into a caramel color. Use medium heat. (Tip: Prepare the pound cake container beforehand.)

2. When caramel turns golden brown transfer into the poundcake container - and let it cool.

3. In another pot, heat the milk and the vanilla essence. Do not let it boil - use medium heat. Mix the liquid periodically.

4. In a bowl, mix the whole egg and the egg yolk. (When breaking the egg, break the eggs first in a separate bowl, then transfer them individually.) Mix the sugar with the whisker and add air to the mixure. Add the milk little by little and mix the two mixtures well. After mixing, use a strainer to make the texture of the liquid smooth. (Do this directly in the poundcake container to save time on dishes).

5. Before putting the pudding in the oven, put the pudding container on a cookie tray and place it in oven. Prepare a kettle with hot water, and pour it into the cookie batter tray. Place it in the middle level of the oven. Then close the oven and wait for 30 min.

6. After 30 min, lower to 150 C (300 - 310 F) and wait another 30 - 40 min. Recommended heating depends on oven. If you do it for too long, the sides become too hard - leave it around 35 min.

7. Use a long toothpick to determine whether it is hard enough by piercing it in the center. You can tell whether its actually ready or not by this.

8. Take out the pudding and let it cool. Then cool it in the fridge.

9. Eat :fork_and_knife:
